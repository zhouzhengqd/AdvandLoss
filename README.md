# AdvandLoss
Paper code: Adversarial Examples Are Exactly Bugs, They Are Relevant to The Loss Function
1) The environment was decleared in the paper;
2) The four-layer neural networks model was built in the model.py file;
3) Then we carried out the train_model.py file, can gain the pre-train nueral network model;
4) Used the attack.py file to generate the adversarial examples;
5) Verified the accuracy of the adversarial examples by attack.py.
